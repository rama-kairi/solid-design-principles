## SOLID Principles

[wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - A class should have only one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle** - A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle** - A class should be substitutable for its subclasses.
- **Interface Segregation Principle** - A class should not have too many methods.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
